This lab uses the ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data.  The data dictionary is at http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/pums_documentation/

NOTE:  To compare a number that is stored as a string to be a number, use CAST.

```
SELECT p.SERIALNO, p.AGEP, h.FPARC, h.FES
FROM ss12ppa AS p JOIN ss12hpa as h
ON p.SERIALNO=h.SERIALNO
WHERE cast(p.AGEP as REAL) BETWEEN 0 AND 18
AND h.FPARC IN ("1", "2", "3")
AND h.FES IN ("5", "6", "7", "8")
```
