1.  Start R Studio. You should have watched the video on the R Studio website before class.

2.  Find and open the document *A (very) short introduction to R* by Paul Torfs and Claudia Brauer. it is on the http://cran.r-project.org website. Look at the left side navigation bar under Documentation -> Contributed.

3.  Start a new R document (in R Studio File -> New File -> R Script)

4.  Starting in section 3 and working your way through the end of section 7, you should type in and run the code in each box of *A (very) short introduction to R*.

5.  Submit a printout of the R Code (with your name) for credit on this lab.

Note: if you type in a line in the R Studio editor, and hit <Ctrl>-<Enter> it will run the line your cursor is on.  Other options is to use the Run or Source buttons to the upper right of the R Studio Editor box.
