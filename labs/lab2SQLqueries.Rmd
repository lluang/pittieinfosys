This lab uses the CrossFit Open data you used in last week's lab. You should start with the database from then that includes the affiliate data and Men's and Women's data from 2019 and 2020.  The goal for this lab is creation of a database tool that an affiliate can use to evaluate their own performance.

Last (family) name:  A-L: Women,  M-Z: Men

1. [2] Create a query that identifies all athletes who competed in both the 2019 and 2020 CrossFit Open, shows their overall rank for each, and calculates the improvement in rank for each athlete. (Note: lower rank is better)  Sort by their 2020 rank.  Note: a lower rank is better.


2. [2] Create a query that for a given affiliate, collect the data of all athletes from that affiliate and gives the number of repeat athletes and the mean and standard deviation of the change in rank between 2019 and 2020



For question 3, use your state or province of birth if you were born in the U.S., Canada, or Australia, your country of birth otherwise.  If there is no applicable affiliate, pick your favorite U.S. state :-)

3. [3] Create a query that for a given state/country, provides a list of all affiliates with repeat athletes in that state/country from the 2019 and 2020 athlete files; with the number of athletes and the mean and standard deviation of their change in rank between 2019 and 2020



4. [3]  Create a query that does the following:

    i.  Select the top affiliate in the area from question 3.
    ii. Display all athletes that are competed in both the 2019 and 2020 CrossFit Open with their overall ranks.
