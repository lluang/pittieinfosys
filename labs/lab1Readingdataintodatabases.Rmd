Note: This lab should be done as a Word file so you can cut and paste MS Access output to answer questions as needed.  When a query is required, you may use the MS Access Query Wizard to design the query, then use the SQL View to display the resulting SQL that you will copy and paste to submit as your answer. Remember to write a narrative that explains how your query works.

1. [4]  Import the 2020 Opens Athletes dataset.  Set the competitor to be the primary key. Check that the field types make sense.  What happened?  What error to do you get and why?  Try again and allow Access to create a primary key.


2. [4]  Load in the remainder of the data files (2019 Opens Scores, 2020 Opens Athletes, 2020 Opens Scores).  Remember to set a text delimiter for the "Scores" files. Develop queries that only keeps athletes and scores from the "Women" and "Men" open (not scaled) divisions (these are open divisions without age qualifiers).  Export these files to csv.  *Save these results, they are much smaller files and will save you time loading data on future labs and homeworks*.


For problems 3 and 4, you will do the lab based on your last name and your birth month.

Last (family) name:  A-L: Women,  M-Z: Men
Birth month:  Jan - June:  2019,  July-December: 2020

3. The final result of the CrossFit Open is the sum of the ranks.  

a. [4] Create a query that calculates the sum of the ranks of each score of athletes in your dataset, then sort the athletes by rank and displays the athlete's name, country, Affiliate of training, Division, and the sum of the ranks.  
b. [2] Create a query that displays the sorted Overall from the athlete table.  Confirm that this gives the same results (Top 10) as the field "Overall rank" from the query from part (a).


4. [6]  Create a query that does the following:

  i. Calculate the rank for each athlete
  ii. Identifies the affiliate for each athlete
  iii. For each affiliate provide the number of athletes participating, the highest rank, and the lowest rank.
  iv. Sorts the affiliates by the number of athletes participating, greatest number first.
    
Select SQL View and copy and paste the results of the SQL view.  Also submit a table (copy and paste into word) with the top 10 affiliates, sorted by the number of athletes entered.

Hint:  Sort the athlete scores by athlete.  How should the ranks be combined to get the sum of ranks?  What column should be used to identify the affiliate?
