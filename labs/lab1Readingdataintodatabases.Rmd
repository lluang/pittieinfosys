Note: * indicates items that need to be part of your submission of this lab.

1.  Download the Titanic data from courseweb and look at it using a text editor (Notepad or the R Studio editor).

2. [*] What character separates fields in this file?  What character identifies text that should be kept in the same data field?  What would happen if you did not identify text that should be kept together?

3. [*] What field would be guaranteed to uniquely identify each row? (Note: it is not the Name).  This will be referred to later as the "Primary Key".

4. [*]  Using the SQLite Browser, create an SQLite database and import the Titanic data into SQLite using the Import menu.   What messages did you see, if any?  How many rows and columns are in the resulting table?  Explain how you determined this.

5. [*] Download and look at the data from the National Survey of Family Growth using a text editor.  How are columns separated?  How is text that should not be separated identified? What column should be guaranteed to be unique and can serve as a primary key?

6. [*]  Create an SQLite database in SQLite and Import the data. What messages did you see, if any? * How many rows and columns are in the resulting table?  Explain how you determined this.

7. [*] Download and look at the codebook from the NSFG.  How do you determine if the responder is pregnant at the time of the survey?  What is the current length of pregnancy for the first survey response where the responder is currently pregnant?

8. [*] How do you determine the end result of the pregnancy (in the case where the mother was not currently pregnant)?  What are the first 10 outcomes? (answer using the word meaning, not the code that is in the database)

Note: The full version of an SQL query is:

```
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY columns
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC]
LIMIT offset, count;
```

While the SELECT and FROM clauses are mandatory, the other clauses (lines above) are only included if you need them.


9.  Open the Titanic database.
10.  [*] Create an SQL query to determine how (i) many women who boarded at Southampton (embarkation = "S") survived and (ii) perished.
    Answer with both the SQL query(ies) and the answers to the question.
    
    
(After lab)  Using R and R Studio, work through Learn X in Y Minutes (X=R) http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/r/
