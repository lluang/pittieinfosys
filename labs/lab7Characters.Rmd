```{r loadtitanic}
titanic <- read.csv("../data/titanictrain.csv")
```
1.  (3 pts) The Titanic accident was in a time when people were identified by their titles. In the Titanic data, How do you identify the title (Mr., Mrs., Miss. etc) of a person.

2.  (5 pts) Read in the titanic data and extract the title of each person.  Make a list of unique titles.
  (hint, how do you find the first letter? how do you know the title is complete? Note: The Countess is a special case, don't worry about getting her territory right, just her title.  Note 2:  in a regular expression, you need to escape the punctuation with a backslash, and you need to escape the backslash with another backslash (i.e. two backslashes before a punctuation mark.)

3.  (2 pts) How many passengers have each title? (hint: declare the list of titles to be a factor and take the summary)
