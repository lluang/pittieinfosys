1.  [4 pts] Read the National Survey of Family Growth Female Pregnancy dataset into R (either from CSV or SQLite). Identify the variables that corresponds to the duration of a completed pregnancy in weeks and the outcome. 

Plot three histograms: 
  a. All live births, 
  b. current pregnancy (pregnancy ongoing at the time of survey), and 
  c. miscarriages. Include axis labels and titles (e.g. , `xlab="Pregnancy length", ylab="Weeks", main="Pregnancy lengths of live births"`).  
  d. Give an interpretation of the third histogram (miscarriage).


2. [6] Plot the relationship between birth weight and birth order.
  a.  What are the variables that represent the birth weight in pounds (1st child of pregnancy) and the birth order?

Ignoring responses where the birth weight was not given (hint: how can you tell) make the following plots. Include axis labels and titles. (e.g. `, xlab="Pregnancy order", ylab = "Birthweight (lbs)", main = "Birthweight by pregnancy order"`)

  b.  Plot a boxplot of birth weight by pregnancy order (note: convert pregnancy order to a factor using `as.factor()`).
  c.  Plot a jitter plot of birthweight by birth order.
  d.  The jitter plot is hard to read. Set the alpha = 1/5 and plot again.
  e.  Why are there so many missing values reported when making these plots? (or what did you do to prevent missing values in this plot)
