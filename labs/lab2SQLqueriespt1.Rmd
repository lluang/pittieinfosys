Note: The full version of an SQL query is:

```
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY columns
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC]
LIMIT offset, count;
```

While the SELECT and FROM clauses are mandatory, the other clauses (lines above) are only included if you need them.


1.  Open the Titanic database.
2.  (*) Create an SQL query to determine how many women who boarded at Southampton (embarkation = "S") survived and perished.
    a. Answer with both the SQL query(ies) and the answers to the question.
3.  (*) Create a Passenger Manifest. It should include the Name, Passenger Class, Sex, Age, Port of Embarkation ('embarked'), and the Cabin. Sort this by last name.  
    a. Answer with your SQL query and the first 5 rows of the result.
4.  (*) In (3), this result is actually NOT in alphabetical (phone book) order.  
    a. Give at least two reasons why you are not able to do this using the SQL you know.
5.  (*) The ship's cruise director wants to know how many children (12 and under) are on the ship. It turns out that you cannot precisely answer this question, so you will have to give a range.
    a.  Create two SQL queries to create an upper and lower limits of this amount.
    b.  Explain to the cruise director why you had to give a range when using just SQL.
