This lab uses the CrossFit Open data you used in last week's lab. You should start with the database from then that includes the affiliate data and Men's and Women's data from 2017 and 2018.  The goal for this lab is creation of a database tool that an affiliate can use to evaluate its own performance.

Last (family) name:  A-L: Women,  M-Z: Men

1. [2] Create a query that identifies all athletes who competed in both the 2017 and 2018 CrossFit Open, shows their overall rank and percentile, and calculates the change in rank and percentile for each athlete

2. [2] Create a query that for a given affiliate, collect the data of all athletes from that affiliate and gives the number of repeat athletes and the mean and standard deviation of the change in rank between 2017 and 2018.

For question 3, use your state or province of birth if you were born in the U.S., Canada, or Australia, your country of birth otherwise.  If there is no applicable affiliate, pick your favorite U.S. state :-)

3. [2] Create a query that for a given state/country, provides a list of all affiliates with repeat athletes in that state/country, with the number of athletes, and the mean and standard deviation of their change in rank between 2017 and 2018.

4. [4]  Create a form that does the following:

    i.  Select an affiliate
    ii. Display all athletes that are competed in both the 2017 and 2018 CrossFit Open with their ranks for each event.
