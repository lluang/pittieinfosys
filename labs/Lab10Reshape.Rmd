# 1. Recode data

In the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), the highest level of education achieved by the mother is identified in the variable `HIEDUC`.  Create a variable `education` that contains the text value of the meaning behind `HIEDUC`.

# 2. Manipulate data

We are interested in looking at the trend in birthweight over time and how education can effect this.  But the birthweight is currently in three sets of columns (for potential triplets).  Create a dataframe with the following columns:
  -  HIEDUC, education,BABYDOB\_Y, BIRTHWGT\_LB, BIRTHWGT\_OZ, birthweight\_oz
  
Note: birthweight\_oz = BIRTHWGT\_LB * BIRTHWGT\_OZ

Note: at some point you need to remove NA and placeholder values from the data.

```
babyweights = babyweights[!is.na(babyweights$BABYDOB_Y) & 
                            babyweights$BABYDOB_Y<9999& 
                            babyweights$BIRTHWGT_LB < 99 & 
                            babyweights$BIRTHWGT_OZ < 99 & 
                            !is.na(babyweights$education), ]
```

#  3. Plotting multiple groups

Plot the time series of the mean birthweight in ounces for each year with one plot for each level of education (e.g. use `facet_wrap(~education)`)
