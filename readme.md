# Information Systems Course

This repository is for creating resources used to teach a new version of the University of Pittsburgh IE0015 Information Systems Engineering course.  The course is intended to teach undergraduate engineers (2nd semester sophomores) the basics of working with data.  There are three components to this course.

1.  Databases
2.  Exploratory data analysis
3.  Data manipulation

## Resources

###  Books

The following are resources we will use.  Data Manipulation with R will be the primary text because that presents information in a way different than all other sources.

1.  Wickham, GGplot2: Elegant graphics for data analysis 2nd ed, Springer
  -  Chapter 2 qplot at http://ggplot2.org/book/qplot.pdf
2.  Grolemund and Wickham, 2017, R for Data Science, OReilly, http://r4ds.had.co.nz/
