-  What is analytics?
-  What questions can we answer using quantitative methods?

#  What is analytics?

## Why are we talking to an analyst?

-  The results of data analysis should be a decision.
-  What is the driver/key variable that will drive the decision to be made?
    -  What information will drive the decision?
    -  What are the possible alternative data outcomes and how will they change your decision?
-  What is the alternative?

## Definition of analytics

- *The Analytics Section of INFORMS is focused on promoting the use of data-driven analytics and fact-based decision making in practice. The Section recognizes that analytics is seen as both (i) a complete business problem solving and decision making process, and (ii) a broad set of analytical methodologies that enable the creation of business value.*  
    -  INFORMS Section on Analytics


## Three categories of Analytics

- Descriptive analytics
    - Prepares and analyzes historical data
    - Identifies patterns from samples for reporting of trends
- Predictive analytics
    - Predicts future probabilities and trends
    - Finds relationships in data that may not be readily apparent with descriptive analysis
- Prescriptive analytics
    - Evaluates and determines new ways to operate
    - Targets business objectives
    - Balances all constraints

## Some methods used analytics (i.e. buzzwards)

-  Business Intelligence - Focus on displaying data summaries from data found in databases. Often refers to visualizations.
-  Statistics - Methods of testing hypothesis using observed data.
-  Data science - Predictive models -  Predict an outcome
-  Operations Research - Mathematical models of operations
    -  Optimization
    -  Queueing
    -  Simulation
    -  Used when determining resources needed or effect of resources employed.
    
    
#  What questions can we answer using quantitative methods?

##  Descriptive analytics

-  How does $A$ compare with $B$?
-  How does $A$ change over time?
-  How much does $A$ vary?

## Predictive analytics

-  What is the current trend of A?
-  There is a new observation $a$ which is a type of A, what are its characteristics?
-  How does my system perform?
-  Event $C$ just occurred, what will A be in the future?

## Prescriptive analytics

-  What is the best way of designing my system?
-  What is the best way to allocating figures for a goal?
-  I am trying to stop someone from accomplishing their goals? What is the best way for them to accomplish their goals, and what is the best way for me to stop them?

#  How do I ask good questions as a consumer of quantitative analysis?

## Why are you talking to an analyst?

-  What are potential results of the data analysis?
-  What kind of argument will you make with the data?
-  What kind of decisions will result from seeing outcomes?

## Talking about results

-  How will the data be used to support the decisions?
-  How should the data be presented to best support the use of the data?
-  Mockups of the output
    -  Example reports of outcomes
    -  Simplified graphs
    -  Sketches of displays or user interfaces to spark discussion of using a tool

## Why are we talking to an analyst?

-  The results of data analysis should be a decision.
-  The results need to advocate one choice over another.
-  Question:  What makes a convincing case of one choice over another?  Will the data analysis provide that case?
    -  What information will drive the decision?
    -  What are the possible alternative data outcomes and how will they change your decision?

## Aspects of an argument

-  Who needs to be convinced? What is their background, their priorities?
-  Are they interested in subjective or objective measurements?
-  Do they need an experiment?

This defines how simple or complex the data analysis needs to be.

## Outcome

-  How will the data analysis be used?
-  How will it be integrated into the organization?
-  Who will own the integration?
-  Who will use it?
-  How will success be measured?

## Who will have to use the results

-  Who will interpret or act on the work?
-  Who are they?
-  What are their requirements?

## Four Aspects of data you need to know

- Volume
- Velocity
- Variety
- Veracity

![3Vs of Big data](figures/BigData3vs.png)<!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->


## Varacity


-  Is the data we are looking at relevant to the question being asked?
-  Data is of uncertain origin, of uncertain quality, and of uncertain relevance.
-  Contrast with the case where the data collection is designed for the purpose of doing the analysis.
-  e.g.  data collection errors, typos, misdefined.


## Volume

<div class="columns-2">
-  How much are you working with?
-  How was it collected?
-  How complete is it?

![3Vs of Big data](figures/BigData3vs.png)
</div>

## Variety

-  How many different examples are in the data set?
-  Does diversity in the dataset match the population of interest?
-  How to ensure that you are not missing entire sections of the population?
    - Did you take special measures to sample difficult to sample elements?
    - Are minority or uncommon elements accounted for in data collection and analysis?

## Velocity

-  Data can be time sensitive.
-  Static data (census)
-  Changing slowly over time (popularity)
-  Linked to an incident where an immediate response is required (natural disaster, major accident, disease outbreak)




## Measures of centrality and variance

-  For every number, there should be a measure of centrality, and a measure of the variation or error.
-  e.g. mean and standard deviation
-  All values should have an estimate of variance.

#  How can I work with quantitative analysts?

##  What is the role of the analysts?

##  How do quantitative analysts work?

![Analysts workflow](figures/tidy1.png)

##  Analysts workflow

-  Read in the data
-  Convert data into usable form
-  Exploratory data analysis
-  Develop hypothesis
-  Data manipulation
-  Modeling
-  Communicate result

##  Working with data

![Analysts workflow](figures/datasciencemethod.png)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

-  Visualizations
-  Tell potential stories through the visualization
-  Raise questions, develop alternative hypothesis

## Transform and model

-  Create falsifiable hypothesis
-  Create experiment/approach to test hypothesis
-  Develop statistical/mathematical model
-  Communicate results with subject matter expert
-  Develop new thesis and epeat

##  Communicate results

-  How to report results
-  How to communicate with stakeholders
-  How to let stakeholders explore scenarios


##  How to ask good questions?

-  Define the problem
    -  Usually a potential decision that needs to be made.
    -  What are the alternative decisions?
-  Think about how the results will be used?
    -  What choices correspond to the possible outcomes of the analysis?
-  What is the role of uncertainty?
    -  How sensitive is the decision making to the possible outcomes of the analysis?
    -  What is the cost of the sensitivity?

#  Example - Hurricane Florence Mass Care resources

##  Hurricane Florence path

![Hurricane Florence Spaghetti Models](figures/Hurricane-Florence-spaghetti-model-1502236.jpg)


##  Decision to be made

-  How much sheltering and feeding resources should be mobilized to be sent into North and South Carolina (and GA and VA) for Hurricane Florence?
    -  Shelter supplies (cots, blankets, showers)
    -  Feeding (kitchens, meals, water, fuel)
    -  People (sheltering, feeding, and kitchen staff)
-  How sensitive is this to errors?
    -  Location?
    -  Quantity?

## What information do we need to decide how much and where?

-  If we cannot get that information, is there a useful proxy?
-  If the information is not directly available, can we build a model?
    - Statistical
    - Operations research


##  What data is available?

-  Hurricane track and estimated wind.
-  Hydrology (river forecasts)
-  Demographics

##  Hydrology

![AHPS Flood gages 09/15/2018](figures/ahpsHURFLORENCE20180915.png)

##  Specific hydrology

![Hurricane Florence Flood gage](figures/chin7HURFLORENCE20180915.png)

## Sources of uncertainty

-  Path it will take
-  Wind
-  Level of flooding on rivers
-  What is the impact on uncertainty?

##  Impact of uncertainty

-  How uncertain is the hurricane location?
-  A truck can travel around 400 miles in a day.
-  What is the impact of being off by 10% on sheltering needs? Feeding needs?
    - 20%
    - what if you would have a better answer the next day?
