This is the git respository associated with University of Pittsburgh IE 0015 Information Systems from 2015-2020 that was available to the students taking the course.
Note that in keeping with practices of the time, the repository has a branch 'Master' which has all of the relevant files.  This is being placed on github for those who may find it useful (not the least is myself, as I've referred to these notes frequently)
