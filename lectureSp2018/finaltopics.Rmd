##  Format

- Same as midterm
- 3, 4 questions. Intent is to make it possible for one hour. You will have two hours
- CoNVO statement will center on announced datasets
- Expect questions around statistics and simulation
    -  May include process map to manipulate data.

## Programming

-  For all questions that are based on algorithms, you may represent your answer in one of the following ways
    -  Process map
    -  Enumerated (numbered) outline
    -  Pseudocode (R, do not worry about getting the syntax correct)

## CoNVO statements

- Given a setting, write a CoNVO statement (four paragraphs)

## Process maps

-  Data manipulation verbs
-  Spread and gather
-  Operations
    -  String operations (stringr)
    -  Date manipulation (lubridate)
    -  Statistical operations (mutate using statistics)
    -  Simulation (random sampling)
    
##  Data manipulation verbs 

1.  Filter (SELECT)
2.  Arrange (ORDER BY)
3.  Select columns
5.  Distinct rows (UNIQUE)
6.  Mutate (SELECT . . . AS new columns)
7.  Summarize (GROUP BY)
8.  Random sample

## Linear Regression

-  Lecture Lecture 12
-  Representing multiple linear regression model
-  Plotting residuals and interpreting residual plots

-  Regression model diagnostics summaries, plots, and interpretation

## Simulation

-  Lecture 13, 14
-  Probability distribution fitting
-  Use of Monte Carlo simulation
